                The international community has recognised the equal right to quality education of everyone and
                committed to achieving gender equality in all fields, including education, through their acceptance of
                international human rights law. This means that states have legal obligations to remove all
                discriminatory barriers, whether they exist in law or in everyday life, and to undertake positive
                measures to bring about equality, including in access of, within, and through education.This campaign
                aims to reach the most vulnerable children, those left behind by the world’s progress in child health,
                education and protection — including girls. Too many girls, because of who they are or where they’re
                born, face unique challenges. Together, we will improve girls education. We will reach every last girl,
                empowering her to grow up healthy, educated and safe. Free to lead her own life, speak her mind and
                determine her future.</p>
